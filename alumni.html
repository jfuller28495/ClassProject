<p> <img src = "images/man-dog.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Man" alt = "Man"/></p>
<br />
<p> Man is a young gentleman, who is always in search of his ball, and who loves to please. A spry and energetic boy, he is sure to delight you and keep you entertained. Man is best suited for a family that loves to play. He is not very fond of cats, however we have not noticed any complete aversion or aggression. </p>
<br />
<p> Update - Man was adopted in January of 2010 by Lisa and Steve Pirelli, who have been in complete adoration of Man since they were introduced. Since his adoption, Man has become a big brother to human siblings Sadie and Charlie, and, according to Lisa, he makes the perfect big brother who always looks after the little ones and keeps them out of trouble. Congratulations to Man and the Pirellis!</p>
<br />
<p> <img src = "images/max-cat.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Max" alt = "Max"/></p>
<br />
<p> Max is a fantastic choice for a family looking for a calm, quiet cat that is great with children. He is loving, docile, and not excitable at all. Our kennel staff adore his consistent personality and the calming effect he has on cats around the shelter.
<br />
<p> Update - Max was adopted in May of 2014 by Kelsi Michaels and her now-fiance Cody Whittaker. Kelsi and Cody have gushed about the fantastic addition Max has been to their home. Kelsi and Cody have a three-year-old daughter together, who has never known life without her best friend, Max. </p>
<br />
<p> <img src = "images/scotty-dog.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Scotty" alt = "Scotty"/></p>
<br />
<p> Scotty is a handsome, inquisitive young man with lots of spunk. He came from a less-than-happy home and was relinquished through no fault of his own. He has been incredibly affectionate and has done well in training and in therapy to overcome the challenges he faced as a result of his former living situation.</p>
<br />
<p> Update - Scotty, or Scotty-dog, as he was known around PTG, was adopted in April of 2016 by Freddie and Frankie Smithson, who have since been back to adopt Tommyboy, another PTG pup. Scotty and Tommyboy (pictured below) have bonded and become best friends right before their family's eyes, and are a big part of their dog moms' lives. </p>
<p> <img src = "images/tommyboy-dog.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "tommyboy" alt = "tommyboy"/></p>
<br />

<p> <img src = "images/sampson-cat.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Sampson" alt = "Sampson"/></p>
<br />
<p> Sampson is often lovingly referred to as the spaz around the shelter. He is absolutely the most energetic and happy cat around. He loves toys and his friends and everyone he meets. Sampson would be best suited for an equally energetic family who has lots of toys and entertainment to offer. </p>
<br />
<p> Update - Sampson was adopted in June of this year by none other than former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle. When Malia and Sasha had determined where they wanted to go to college, the Obamas celebrated by contributing to our organization as part of their fondness for animals and animal rescues. </p>
