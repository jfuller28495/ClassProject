<h1> Welcome to Pets to Go's Adoptables Page </h1>
 <p> Here is where you will find some of the most eligible adoptables we have to offer! </p>
 
 <div class = "adoptables">
 
 <br />
<p> <img src = "images/beauregard-dog.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Beauregard" alt = "Beauregard"/></p>
<br />
<p> Beauregard is a young gentleman, always willing to please. A calm and gentle boy, he is sure to delight you and keep you entertained, or simply keep you company if that's what you want. </p>
<br />
<p> <img src = "images/carmichael-cat.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Carmichael" alt = "Carmichael"/></p>
<br />
<p> Carmichael is a fantastic choice for a furry feline companion. He is loving, caring, and a source of great personality and entertainment. Our kennel staff are incredibly fond of him and his ability to befriend everyone he meets, dog and cat alike. 
<br />

<p> <img src = "images/charice-dog.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Charice" alt = "Charice"/></p>
<br />
<p> Charice is a beautiful girl with lots of spunk. She comes from a very loving home that relinquished her through no fault of her own. She has been incredibly affectionate and a great help around the shelter. She helps calm and acquaint the new members of the shelter, and tends to those who are recovering from surgeries. She is the perfect choice for a family of any size and temperament, and has no vices. </p>
<br />

<p> <img src = "images/jax-cat.jpg" height = "500px" width = "900px" title = "Jax" alt = "Jax"/></p>
<br />
<p> Jax is often lovingly referred to as the spaz around the shelter. He is absolutely the most energetic and happy cat around. He loves toys and his friends and everyone he meets. Jax would be best suited for an equally energetic family who has lots of toys and entertainment to offer. </p>
<br />
