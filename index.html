<h1> Welcome to Pets to Go's Website! </h1>
 <p> Our organization got it's start in 2009 after our founders recognized a serious need for a shelter that rescues homeless animals. <em> We pride ourselves in having rescued over 18,000 homeless cats and dogs</em> since our founding. To this day, we take in an average of five animals per day and work hard to place them with the best home possible. </p>
 
 <h1> Recent News </h1>
 <p> <strong> October - </strong> Our Adopt-A-Palooza month succeeded in finding homes for 15 cats and 8 dogs, which freed up space for us to bring in 23 new animals from hurricane-affected areas of the country. We are currently working on treating those animals and getting them ready for adoption, and we will post pictures of them as soon as we can! </p>
 
 <p> <strong> November - </strong> This month, we give thanks for all of the wonderful staff and families that we have had the pleasure of working with in our nearly 9 years of operation. Without the support of everyone around us, we would not be where we are today! In order to show our thanks to the community, we are offering free treats for your furry friend, as well as discount pet wellness services with our in-house groomers and veterinarians. We're grateful for you, and your pets are too! Show them a little extra love this month. </p>

 <p> <strong> December - </strong>Throughout the month of December, we will be offering a different holiday special each day. Check out your monthly newsletter for great deals on grooming, pet clothes, toys, veterinary services, pet daycare, and much more! For those of you who are traveling for the holidays, we're offering discounts on our round-the-clock kenneling service, with special holiday gifts for your furry friend while you're away. If you donate to our hurricane relief efforts, or to our general pet-rescue fund, you'll receive some extra holiday cheer this year! </p>

 <h2> Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
 <div id = "faqs">
	<ul>
		<li class = "question">Question: Do I need to provide proof of income to be approved for adoption?</li>
		<li class = "answer"> Answer: Yes, you do. In order to provide the best possible home for our furry friends, we insist that would-be adoptive families submit proof of income. So many of our friends are put up for adoption because of financial hardships, we want to make sure they never go through that again. </li>
		<br />
		<li class = "question"> Question: Do I need to submit to a home visit in order to complete the adoption process? </li>
		<li class = "answer"> Answer: Yes. Unless you've previously adopted an animal through PTG, it is important that we verify your living situation, to ensure the home is a healthy environment for a pet. We check factors like location, cleanliness, upkeep, whether or not the yard is fenced in, the neighborhood's position in relation to dog parks and vet clinics, etc. While we may point out concerns in these areas and more, a concern does not necessarily bar you from adoption, however we will insist that your home meet a certain criteria before we will allow your new pet to be brought home. </li>
		<br />
		<li class = "question"> Question: What do I need to do in order to be considered for adoption? </li>
		<li class = "answer"> Answer: Easy! Visit our Adoptables page to learn more about the furry friends we have available, fill out an application for those you're interested in meeting, schedule a visit to meet them, submit proof of income, and schedule a home visit. Once you've passed through all of the levels of the application process, you can bring your new friend home. Once you and your new family member have had a few months to adjust, we will send you a survey asking you to rate how we did, and share pictures of your success story for future adopters. </li>
		<br />
		<li class = "question"> Question: What if my new pet and I don't get along right away? </li>
		<li class = "answer"> Answer: We offer workshops and traning to make your pet's transition into your home as easy and smooth as possible. If you begin to experience issues with your new furry friend and would like to work it out with one of our trained specialists, just give us a call! Sessions are all funded through at-will donations, and we guarantee your success! If it doesn't work out between you and your pet after a few sessions with our experts, we will offer to match you with a different furry friend instead. We want you and your pet to be as happy as possible! </li>
